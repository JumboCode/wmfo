# WMFO

## Installation
1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager for Mac OS
1. Install Node and NPM with `brew install node`. You may need to change some XCode permissions (you'll be prompted if that's the case)
1. In the root directory of the repo, run `./setup.sh` which will try to install all the necessary dependencies and build the front end for the first time. There should be no errors.

## Running
1. Change into the `server/` directory with `cd server/`
1. Do `npm run dev`. If you have set everything up in the Installation section, you should be able to go to `localhost:5000` in your browser and see an example page.
